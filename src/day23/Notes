Common property value should be static and assign value to it in the template(class) itself
Static does not belong to Object and as a result cannot be called using Object Name
Static belongs to CMA, which in turn is within the template, so indirectly static belongs to the class and
hence should be called using class name to which it belongs
If its static --> Call it by class name
If its not static ---> Call it by object name
