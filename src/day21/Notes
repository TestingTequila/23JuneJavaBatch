OOPs: Object Oriented Programming

PolyMorphism: Poly(Many) + Morphism(Forms)
  Methods with same name can exist in many forms

Method Overloading:
   In a class we can have two or more methods with the same name, provided that,
   the signature of methods are different

   How can we make signature different:
      by changing the data type
      by changing the order of data type
      by changing the count of parameters

      ---------------------------------------------------------
         public void addition(double a, int b) //double, int
          {
              double sum =a+b;
              System.out.println("Addition: " + sum);
          }

         public void addition(double c, int d) // double, int
          {
               double sum =a+b;
               System.out.println("Addition: " + sum);
          }

         public void addition1(int c, int d) // int, int
          {
               double sum =a+b;
               System.out.println("Addition: " + sum);
          }

          public void addition2(int c, int d) // int, int
           {
               double sum =a+b;
               System.out.println("Addition: " + sum);
           }

Method overloading happens within the same class
Method overloading is also known as static polymorphism or Compile Time Polymorphism
