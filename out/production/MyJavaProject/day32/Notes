1. Can we create object of an interface - No
2. Can we create constructor inside an interface - No
3. Can we create object of an Abstract Class - No
4. Can we create constructor inside an Abstract Class - Yes
5. Can abstract method be final -No
6. Can abstract method be static -- No
7. Can abstract method be private -- No
8. variables value cannot be overridden
===================================================
In a P-C relationship
  -variables can be inherited but can't be overridden
  -static method can be inherited but can't be overridden
  -final method can be inherited but can't be overridden
  => The difference b/w static and final is in this context is: We call static variable/method using class name
     and final variable/method using ClassName

9. variables in an interface are both static and final by default, since they are final, you have to assign value to
   them at the time of creation and static because you cannot create object of an interface, so the only
   option left is to call them using interface name and that's possible only if variable is static.

10. An interface can have static method with body or a method with 'default' keyword
    default method of an interface can be both inherited and overridden, but to override
    a default method from interface into its child class, we must change the access modifier
    of method from default to public in the child class
