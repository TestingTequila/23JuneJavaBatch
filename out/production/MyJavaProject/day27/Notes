1. 'this' keyword is used to differentiate b/w global variable and parameter with the same name.
   Using this keyword, we can call the global variables of the class

2. Calling one constructor inside of other constructor using 'this'
   You can call only one constructor inside of other Constructor
   => Constructor calling should be the first statement inside of other Constructor

3. Calling one method inside of other method

4. Builder pattern


Ways to update an existing Object:
1. through setter method
2. Through Call By Reference

Scenario 1: setting the value of private variable using Constructor
            updating it using setter method or updating it using Call By Reference


Scenario 2: setting the value of private variable using setter method
            updating it using Call By Reference

            Difference b/w setter and Call by reference
            => setter method is used to update one property at a time of the same object
            => Call By Reference can be used to update multiple properties of the same object
