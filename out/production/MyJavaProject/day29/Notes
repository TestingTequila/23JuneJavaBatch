Class - A class has only concrete methods
Abstract Class - An abstract class can hold both  concrete and Abstract methods
Interface - An Interface will hold only and only Abstract Methods


We cannot create Object of an Abstract Class coz if this was allowed, using abstract class reference we will
be able to call the abstract method, which is not implemented within abstract class and as a result JVM will not know
what to do with it


We cannot create Object of an Interface coz if this was allowed, using Interface reference we will
be able to call the abstract methods, which is not implemented within Interface and as a result JVM will not know
what to do with it

A class Cannot have more than one parent class as having more than one parent will lead to diamond problem
In simple language, we say, Multiple inheritance isn't allowed among CLASSES in Java
