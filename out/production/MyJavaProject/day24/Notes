The moment global variable is created, JVM assigns then their default value.

A CONSTRUCTOR IS USED TO INITIALIZE THE GLOBAL VARIABLES OF THE CLASS WITH SOME MEANINGFUL VALUE.

A CONSTRUCTOR IS A SPECIAL METHOD


WHY CONSTRUCTOR IS A METHOD?
BECAUSE METHODS ARE ACTION PERFORMED OVER CLASS/GLOBAL VARIABLES AND HERE IN CASE OF CONSTRUCTOR IT IS ALSO
PERFORMING ACTION OVER GLOBAL VARIABLE BY ASSIGNING THEM SOME MEANINGFUL VALUE

WHY CONSTRUCTOR IS A SPECIAL METHOD?

1. BECAUSE, A NORMAL METHOD CAN PERFORM ANY ACTION OVER GLOBAL VARIABLES AS PER THE LOGIC REQUIREMENT BUT
A CONSTRUCTOR WILL PERFORM ONLY AND ONLY ONE ACTION OVER CLASS/GLOBAL VARIABLES AND THAT ACTION IS
ASSIGNING MEANINGFUL VALUE TO GLOBAL VARIABLES
2. A CONSTRUCTOR WILL NOT HAVE RETURN TYPE
3. A CONSTRUCTOR WILL HAVE ONLY AND ONLY THE NAME OF THE CLASS TO WHICH IT BELONGS
4. NORMAL METHODS NEEDS TO BE CALLED EXPLICITLY EITHER THROUGH OBJECT NAME OR CLASS NAME BUT
   CONSTRUCTORS ARE CALLED AUTOMATICALLY, THE MOMENT WE CREATE OBJECT OF THE CLASS

There are two types of constructors

-default constructor
-Parametrized Constructor

The moment we create a class, default constructor already exists and is not visible to our naked eyes

Rules for creating a constructor

//DEFAULT CONSTRUCTOR
accessModifier  nameOfTheClass()
{

}

//PARAMETRIZED CONSTRUCTOR
accessModifier  nameOfTheClass(parameters)
{

}
