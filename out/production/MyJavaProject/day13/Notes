1. if else : To make single decision
2. if else if: To make multiple decisions
3. switch statement: To make multiple decisions but is faster than if else if

Drawback of switch statement:
cannot be used with range values >, <, >=, <=
doesn't support few data types as : long, float, double, boolean
after every condition use break keyword else this will give ambiguous result...
