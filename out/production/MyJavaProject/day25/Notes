=============================================================================================
Encapsulation involves bundling variables and the methods into a single unit, known as a class.
=> Whenever we are creating a variable or a method please ensure you are doing this within the class

   In encapsulation, the variables of a class should be made private
   and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class.
   Therefore, it is also known as data hiding.

   //create private variables and access them through setter and getter methods

   Class A: public variable, public method
   Class B: private variable, private method ----
   Class C: private variable, public method  <----
   Class D: public variable, private method

//1. private variable, public method[setter/getter]
//2. constructors, public method[getter]
//3. constructor, setter, public method getter
//4. private method within public method

// For setting the value of a private variable we use setter method and Constructors
